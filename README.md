# Explore Tokyo

This website is my second Milestone Project on the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Course.

My project is a travel website about Tokyo, Japan. I chose this project idea because I have travelled to Japan many times and want to showcase the best 
that Tokyo has to offer. I hope that other people will be inspired to travel there after using my website. The project consists of HTML, CSS and Javascript and 
I have used the Google Maps API as well as EmailJS. 
The link to the live site can be found [here]
